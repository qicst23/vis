## Interpretation Guidelines

### How to Use This Report

1. **High-priority candidates:** Focus on paths with:
   - High attention scores (>0.6)
   - Short path length (2 hops)
   - Mechanistically plausible intermediate nodes

2. **Validation steps:**
   - Check if intermediate drugs share mechanism with Inebilizumab
   - Verify disease-gene associations in literature
   - Look for clinical evidence supporting the connection

3. **Risk assessment:**
   - Low attention scores (<0.5) indicate weaker evidence
   - Longer paths have more assumptions/uncertainty
   - Consider known side effects of similar drugs

### Attention Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Confidence Level | Interpretation |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| 0.70+ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very High | Strong biological relationship |
| 0.60-0.70 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Good evidence for connection |
| 0.50-0.60 | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | Moderate support |
| 0.40-0.50 | ⭐⭐ Low | Weak connection |
| <0.40 | ⭐ Very Low | Speculative |

## About Inebilizumab's Mechanism

Inebilizumab (Uplizna) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets **CD19**, a protein found on the surface of B cells. Key points:

- **Target:** CD19 is expressed on B cells from early development through plasma cell differentiation
- **Mechanism:** Binds CD19 and triggers B cell depletion via ADCC
- **Effect:** Reduces B cell-mediated inflammation and autoimmunity
- **Current Use:** Approved for NMOSD, an autoimmune condition affecting the optic nerves and spinal cord

### Why Drug Similarity Paths Matter for Inebilizumab

Many of Inebilizumab's predicted paths go through other drugs because:

1. **Similar antibody drugs** (like Rituximab, which targets CD20) share the B-cell depletion mechanism
2. **Immunomodulatory drugs** (like Cladribine) affect similar immune cell populations
3. **Anti-inflammatory drugs** may have overlapping therapeutic applications
