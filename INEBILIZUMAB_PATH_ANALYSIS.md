## 5. Interpretation Guidelines

### Attention Score Scale

| Score Range | Confidence | Interpretation |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| ≥ 0.70 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very High | Strong biological relationship |
| 0.60 - 0.70 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Good evidence for connection |
| 0.50 - 0.60 | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | Moderate support |
| 0.40 - 0.50 | ⭐⭐ Low | Weak connection |
| < 0.40 | ⭐ Very Low | Speculative |

### How to Use This Report

1. **Prioritize high-scoring paths**: Focus on paths with combined scores > 0.45
2. **Validate intermediate nodes**: Cross-reference proteins/drugs with literature
3. **Consider path length**: Shorter paths (2-3 hops) are generally more reliable
4. **Check for known associations**: Some paths may represent known indications
